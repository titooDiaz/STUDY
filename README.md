# 🧠 Quantum Repository: A Study Archive Beyond Time

> *"Knowledge is not static — it evolves, branches, and rewrites itself. This repository is a glimpse into that evolution."*

Welcome to my personal **Study Vault** — a digital collection of my learning process, structured for clarity, organized for efficiency, and designed with the future in mind.  
Inside, you'll find a curated chaos of handwritten notes, typed documents, solved exercises, and full books — all meticulously organized into thematic folders.

## 📁 What You'll Find

- 🗂 **Folders by Topic**  
  Each folder focuses on a specific subject area (math, physics, computer science, etc.).  
  Subfolders contain exercises, summaries, key notes, and personal reflections.

- 📜 **Handwritten Notes & Scans**  
  Sometimes the best ideas are scribbled in the margins. Expect raw sketches and page scans.

- 📄 **Typed Documents**  
  Clean, formatted notes and guides written as I study or teach.

- 📘 **Books & References**  
  PDFs or links to some books I use regularly — for educational purposes only.

  Step-by-step solutions to exercises, organized by difficulty and topic.

It holds some of the few things I review and revisit — not everything, but the essential fragments that make up my journey.
